Things to do in the HILR Form Submission Script

TODO: code/HILR_formscript.gs.js
FIXME - if a response contains quotation marks, escape them; may be
    possible to use single quotes to contain the double quotes, but
    will have to scan first.  
FIXME - reduce or eliminate the debug info at the end of emails
    sent to me.
